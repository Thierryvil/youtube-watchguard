            "Waves of the World Filmers:\nChris Kincade: https://www.instagram.com/chriskincade.wotw \nAndre Botha: https://www.instagram.com/andre_botha_662 \nJustin Mack: https://www.instagram.com/jmack808 \nJr Maosi: https://www.instagram.com/jrmaosi\nAndy Potts: https://www.instagram.com/apotts\nBoris Martinet: https://www.instagram.com/bogus689\nSteven Tiralongo: https://www.instagram.com/stories/tiralongo\n🔵4k (ASMR) 10 Hour Store Loop - Hawaii Surfing - With Relaxing Music☑️\n💻 Connect with Waves of the World on social media:\nFacebook ▶️ https://www.facebook.com/groups/wavesoftheworld\nInstagram ▶️ https://www.instagram.com/chriskincade.wotw/\nThe reef at Pipe is a flat tabletop reef, with several caverns on the inside, creating a giant air bubble that pops on the front of the wave when the wave lurches upwards just before breaking.[3] There are also several jagged, underwater lava spires that can injure fallen surfers. When sand accumulates on the reef at Pipeline, the waves can become unpredictable and violently \"close out,\" (break all at once instead of peeling in a way that allows a surfer to ride the wave). A strong swell (a formation of long-wavelength surface waves) from the west clears out the sand in the reef, and after that, a strong north swell can give rise to the best waves.[4]\n\nThere are four waves associated with Pipeline. The left (which means the wave breaks from left to right from the perspective of a watcher on shore) known as Pipeline (a.k.a. First Reef) is the most commonly surfed and photographed. When the reef is hit by a north swell, the peak (the highest tipping-point of the wave where it begins to curl) becomes an A-frame shaped wave, with Pipe closing out a bit and peeling off left, and the equally famous Backdoor Pipeline peeling away to the right at the same time. As the size at Pipe increases, over 12 feet usually, Second Reef on the outside (further out into the deeper ocean waters) starts breaking, with longer walls (the unbroken face of the wave that the surfer slides across), and more size. At an extreme size, an area called Third Reef even further outside starts to break with giant waves.[5]\n\nSurfers\nNumerous surfers and photographers have been killed at Pipeline, including Jon Mozo and Tahitian Malik Joyeux, who was famous for his heavy charging (gutsy surfing) at Teahupo'o.[6] Many people have died or been seriously injured at Pipeline. Pipeline has been called one of the world's deadliest waves.[7] Its average wave is 9 feet (3 m), but it can be as tall as 20 feet.[8] Especially perilous are sections of shallow reef known as \"Off the Wall\" and \"Backdoor\".[9]\n\nA few of the notable surfers at Pipeline are Phil Edwards (surfer) (who is credited as the first person to surf it),[10] Butch Van Artsdalen, Gerry Lopez, Mike Stewart, Shaun Tomson, Mark Richards, Wayne 'Rabbit' Bartholomew, Peter Townend, Michael Ho, Simon Anderson, Tom Carroll, Sunny Garcia, Kelly Slater, Danny Fuller, Jamie O'Brien, Rob Machado, Andy Irons, Mick Fanning, Gabriel Medina, John John Florence and Italo Ferreira.[11][12][13]\n\nCompetitions\nThe top surfing competitions at this spot include the Pipe Masters (board surfing), the Volcom Pipe Pro, the IBA Pipeline Pro (bodyboarding), and the Pipeline Bodysurfing Classic.[14] Surfers can also submit videos to Surfline's Wave of the Winter competition. The competition focuses on beaches on Oahu's north shore, including Pipeline.[15]\n💬Let me know what you thought of today's video comment section down below.  \n\n✨  And if you like this video, consider subscribing to Waves of the World using this Link! ⤵️\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVo06dBGK9VBBhq15wJxZHQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThank you for watching!! \n\n********************\n🎥 Welcome and Aloha to the Official Youtube Channel of Chris Kincade Media - Waves of the World 🎬\n\nDo you like watching relaxing surfing videos, with soothing music and ocean sounds in the background? 🏄\u200d♂️ If so, you’ve come to the right channel!\n\n➡️ My name is Chris Kincade and my videos focus primarily on surfing, bodyboarding, and lifestyle.

When sand accumulates on the reef at Pipeline, the waves can become unpredictable and violently \"close out,\" (break all at once instead of peeling in a way that allows a surfer to ride the wave). A strong swell (a formation of long-wavelength surface waves) from the west clears out the sand in the reef, and after that, a strong north swell can give rise to the best waves.[4]\n\nThere are four waves associated with Pipeline. The left (which means the wave breaks from left to right from the perspective of a watcher on shore) known as Pipeline (a.k.a. First Reef) is the most commonly surfed and photographed. When the reef is hit by a north swell, the peak (the highest tipping-point of the wave where it begins to curl) becomes an A-frame shaped wave, with Pipe closing out a bit and peeling off left, and the equally famous Backdoor Pipeline peeling away to the right at the same time. As the size at Pipe increases, over 12 feet usually, Second Reef on the outside (further out into the deeper ocean waters) starts breaking, with longer walls (the unbroken face of the wave that the surfer slides across), and more size. At an extreme size, an area called Third Reef even further outside starts to break with giant waves.[5]\n\nSurfers\nNumerous surfers and photographers have been killed at Pipeline, including Jon Mozo and Tahitian Malik Joyeux, who was famous for his heavy charging (gutsy surfing) at Teahupo'o.[6] Many people have died or been seriously injured at Pipeline. Pipeline has been called one of the world's deadliest waves.[7] Its average wave is 9 feet (3 m), but it can be as tall as 20 feet.[8] Especially perilous are sections of shallow reef known as \"Off the Wall\" and \"Backdoor\".[9]\n\nA few of the notable surfers at Pipeline are Phil Edwards (surfer) (who is credited as the first person to surf it),[10] Butch Van Artsdalen, Gerry Lopez, Mike Stewart, Shaun Tomson, Mark Richards, Wayne 'Rabbit' Bartholomew, Peter Townend, Michael Ho, Simon Anderson, Tom Carroll, Sunny Garcia, Kelly Slater, Danny Fuller, Jamie O'Brien, Rob Machado, Andy Irons, Mick Fanning, Gabriel Medina, John John Florence and Italo Ferreira.[11][12][13]\n\nCompetitions\nThe top surfing competitions at this spot include the Pipe Masters (board surfing), the Volcom Pipe Pro, the IBA Pipeline Pro (bodyboarding), and the Pipeline Bodysurfing Classic.[14] Surfers can also submit videos to Surfline's Wave of the Winter competition. The competition focuses on beaches on Oahu's north shore, including Pipeline.[15]\n💬Let me know what you thought of today's video comment section down below.  \n\n✨  And if you like this video, consider subscribing to Waves of the World using this Link! ⤵️\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVo06dBGK9VBBhq15wJxZHQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThank you for watching!! \n\n********************\n🎥 Welcome and Aloha to the Official Youtube Channel of Chris Kincade Media - Waves of the World 🎬\n\nDo you like watching relaxing surfing videos, with soothing music and ocean sounds in the background? 🏄\u200d♂️ If so, you’ve come to the right channel!\n\n➡️ My name is Chris Kincade and my videos focus primarily on surfing, bodyboarding, and lifestyle.

            "What occurred on January 22, 2023, at Waimea Bay on the North Shore of Oahu is nothing short of historical.  We're simply doing our best to document Hawaiian Surf History here. \n\nHands down, the most epic surf event in recent memory and other surf photographers, some of whom have been filming these events for a long time, agreed and said similar things.  What a coincidence that exactly one year after 2022's (Jan 22, 2022) biggest and most epic Waimea Bay Surf day, we have another epic day, just bigger, sunnier, more exciting, and better in every way!\n\nEddie Aikau was a Hawaiian lifeguard and surfer. As the first lifeguard at Waimea Bay on the island of Oahu, he saved over 500 people and became famous for surfing the big Hawaiian surf, winning several awards.  In 1978, He sacrificed his life trying to help the crew aboard the voyaging canoe Hōkūleʻa.  In Eddie Aikau's honor, \"The Eddie Aikau Big Wave Invitational\" Waimea Bay Big Wave Surf Contest was held on Jan 22, 2023 for the first time since February 25, 2016.  \n\nAlso, reported by Derek Rielly from Beach Grit about Luke Shepardson winning the contest: \nHONOLULU COUNTY LIFEGUARD LUKE SHEPARDSON WHO WON WORLD’S MOST PRESTIGIOUS BIG-WAVE CONTEST ON “BEST DAY IN SURFING HISTORY” CUTS SHORT INTERVIEWS TO RETURN TO WORK, “I GOTTA GET BACK TO THE TOWER TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IS OKAY!”\n\nIf you enjoy the content, pls Like, Comment, and Subscribe. 🤙🏽\n- Mahalo\n\nIf you know who an Unidentified surfer is, pls help us with mention in the comments.

              "What occurred on January 22, 2023, at Waimea Bay on the North Shore of Oahu is nothing short of historical.  We're simply doing our best to document Hawaiian Surf History here. \n\nHands down, the most epic surf event in recent memory and other surf photographers, some of whom have been filming these events for a long time, agreed and said similar things.  What a coincidence that exactly one year after 2022's (Jan 22, 2022) biggest and most epic Waimea Bay Surf day, we have another epic day, just bigger, sunnier, more exciting, and better in every way!\n\nEddie Aikau was a Hawaiian lifeguard and surfer. As the first lifeguard at Waimea Bay on the island of Oahu, he saved over 500 people and became famous for surfing the big Hawaiian surf, winning several awards.  In 1978, He sacrificed his life trying to help the crew aboard the voyaging canoe Hōkūleʻa.  In Eddie Aikau's honor, \"The Eddie Aikau Big Wave Invitational\" Waimea Bay Big Wave Surf Contest was held on Jan 22, 2023 for the first time since February 25, 2016.  \n\nAlso, reported by Derek Rielly from Beach Grit about Luke Shepardson winning the contest: \nHONOLULU COUNTY LIFEGUARD LUKE SHEPARDSON WHO WON WORLD’S MOST PRESTIGIOUS BIG-WAVE CONTEST ON “BEST DAY IN SURFING HISTORY” CUTS SHORT INTERVIEWS TO RETURN TO WORK, “I GOTTA GET BACK TO THE TOWER TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IS OKAY!”\n\nIf you enjoy the content, pls Like, Comment, and Subscribe. 🤙🏽\n- Mahalo\n\nIf you know who an Unidentified surfer is, pls help us with mention in the comments.

How do you ride Tahiti\'s infamous surf break?\nThe story of Teahupoo and surfing is not a new one. The town of Teahupoo has seen surfers coming from all regions of the globe since the 1960s.\n\nBack then, wave riders discovered that it was possible to paddle out to a reasonable surf break in only fifteen minutes.\n\nThe first surfer to claim the first ride at Teahupoo was Tahitian Thierry Vernaudon in 1985. A few local friends support his story.\n\nThe entire island is surrounded by coral atolls, making for exciting surf.\nFor Mike Stewart and Ben Severson - two experienced bodyboarders visiting Tahiti - this was almost the perfect wedge.\n\nFollowing in the steps of Vernaudon, they returned to Hawaii from Tahiti and brought with them the word "Teahupoo."\n\nTeahupoo\'s defining moment came in 1998, at the Gotcha Tahiti Pro. Teahupoo was going wild, pumping serious, breathtaking waves.\n\nThe South Pacific surf beast, affectionately nicknamed "Chopes," grabbed everyone\'s attention, and before long, the big wave surfing elite were arriving in Tahiti.\nIf you want to surf Teahupoo as a "once-in-a-lifetime" experience, first of all, don\'t risk your life. Pick a head-high day and start getting used to the fast and hollow drop.\n\nThen, after ten waves and suitable confidence, go for a barreling ride to feel the power and speed of Tahiti.\n\nAre you unsure where to sit in the line-up? No worries. Depending on the direction of the swell, there are only three take-off spots in Teahupoo.\n\nThe hardest and most challenging spot is the southern surf peak. Expect a deep take-off, with no mistakes accepted.\n\nThe southwest is the most popular one. You can also have a backdoor experience on the western elbow of Teahupoo.\n\nThe Millennium Wave\nThe heaviest wave in the world has claimed lives, but it has also crowned unforgettable surf champions and their epic rides.\n\nLaird Hamilton scored the famous "Millennium Wave" here, and Any Irons took the title of "King of Teahupoo" with him to the skies, forever.\nThe Tahitian pearl can quickly change its appearance if wind and swell decide to head in different ways.\n\nThe best and classic swell direction in Teahupoo is south-southwest, while a northern breeze will ensure its glassy look.\n\nTeahupoo is a vibrant and mutant slab breaking over a shallow live reef.\n\nIts wave face is much bigger than its back and, therefore, offers a heavy, liquid, tubular ride that can even be surfed in 45-foot conditions.\n\nAre you ready for it?\n#Teahupoo#Surfing#WavesoftheWorld',

          description:
            "The Skeleton Bay Shootout presented by Monster Energy took place over three days in late June in non-stop three-to-six foot barrels in Namibia. The speciality event looks to recognise the standout surfers of the swell at  the best wave in the world and the rules are simple – show up and pull in.\n\n“The Skeleton Bay Shootout is a peer-judged event and it’s pretty underground. No-ones really knows when it will happen, it’ll just pop-up depending on the swell and whoever is there is there,” says Eli Beukes, who put in a solid showing on his first trip to the iconic left-hander on the edge of the Namib Desert. “It’s pretty cool because it’s mostly going by word of mouth and whoever has been the surfer of the swell or gets the best barrel will get a bit of a cash prize at the end.”\n\nThis was essentially a dry-run for the concept. Now Now Media is planning a series of Shootouts based on the same idea at some of the most incredible waves around the world in 2024 and looking to bump up the prize money significantly. The prizes are a nice way to recognise who was charging but it’s not about the money. There’s always so much stoke when waves like this are firing and anybody who gets a good wave out there is a winner the end of the day. The Shootout is essentially a celebration of that.\n\nA Now Now Media Production presented by Monster Energy\nProduced by Alan van Gysen\nEdited by Dane Staples\nDirected by Will Bendix\nExecutive Producers Ryan Franklin & Ryan Payne\nDirector of Photography Alan van Gysen\nFirst Camera Pete Beukes",
